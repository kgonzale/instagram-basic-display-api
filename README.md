### Design

Basically top down, my aim was to go for a card, user input does not work as I could not get the instagram api working, therefore we have mock data

A carousel was planned but it took too long to figure out how to create a CSS carousel, and I couldn't find good documentation on module $injects.

### Problems and Future enhancements

Work on the what information we are passing into discord. Have a script to read through all messages and save it into an excel spreadsheet, or whatever type of format to help with the scraping of information. 

CSS can definitely be improved. Right now it's plain.
